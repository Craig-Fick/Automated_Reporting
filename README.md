# Automated_Reporting


Context:

The purpose of this project was to create an automated report that I could send out quickly. Thinking back to my days where I had to create weekly reports using Microsoft Powerpoint, the amount of time I spent plugging in all of the details could have been spent doing something else productive. So I found an old report and thought how I would speed up the proceess.

In the project I created data to reflect similar statisics I would have had on my old weekly reports, calculated some inference statistics, created visuals, and created a word document with all of the needed information. The code would then email out the word document as attachment to any recipients upon completion. Intitially this report would have taken me an hour or more to create.

Additional steps to reduce time:
   - with the simple step of importing data, it will be pretty easy to manipulate the code.
   - To speed up the process without the use of Microsoft Excel, a GUI or user-friendly window can be created to allow a user to enter the information directly just by typing the    data directly into the window along with creating the report and emailing. This would be a relatively simple build and would reduce time even more.

   - Example of my old work reports.
   - Example of the new automated report.
   - The code used to create the automated report.
